Collision Sensor Plug-in for RoboDK
===================================================

This example shows how to simulate sensors, such as a laser sensors or contact switches.
It uses collision detection between a sensor and its environnement to update a station parameter (simulated digital input).

* Right-click an Object to set it as a sensor.
* Any other Object touching any part of the sensor will trigger it.
* The sensor status (0 or 1) is updated in the Station parameters using the sensor Object name.
