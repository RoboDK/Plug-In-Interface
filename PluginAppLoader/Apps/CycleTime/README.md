# Cycle Time

The Cycle Time Add-In allows you to obtain cycle time estimates for robot programs. You can retrieve valuable metrics from your robot programs, such as program feasibility, travel length (mm) and time (seconds). 

You can also perform cycle time study by comparing different robot speed for the same program.

## Features

 - Generate cycle time estimates for one or more programs
 - Compare cycle time based on different robot speeds.
 - Save cycle time estimates to .CSV files
