# Box Spawner

The Box Spawner App for RoboDK lets you programmatically add box objects in your RoboDK Station.
You can customize the spawner location, box parameters, and request a new box from a RoboDK Program.
Multiple spawner location are supported by providing a spawner ID in your program call.
