Surface Pattern Generator
=============================

The Surface Pattern Generator (SPG) App let's you generate surface patterns on an object surface, with its associated Curve Follow Project (CFP).

Setup
------------------------
* Place a Frame in the station at the same level in the tree as the object and with the desired name of the CFP.
* Orient the frame so that the Z axis points towards the object surface, and the X and Y axis in the desired orientation.


Generating the pattern
---------------------------
* Open the SPG App and select the desired object
* Enter the pattern settings, such as the dimensions and resolution of the pattern, the tool settings, etc.
* Update the pattern to see the generate lines, CFP, and program.
* Save the settings
